First I tried using the smal dataset with a small neural network with only one dense layer with 3 units and dropout of 0.5. With this option I was getting strange values, such as 1.000 accuracy and 0.89 loss. I think this happens because of the small dataset and the small neural network. After this I tried a larger neural network and I was getting the same strange values. But them I set the dropout to 0.2, lower than before, and the values started to make sense. I think that with small datasets a big dropout can make the AI worse.
